This is a Linux-specific rewrite of the excellent work of @thirtythreedown who figured out [the protocols for this printer](https://github.com/thirtythreedown/CTP500PrinterApp).
It lets Linux handle the bluetooth communications and simply treats the bluetooth channel as a serial port.

**IMPORTANT**
You must download the Lucon truetype font (*Lucon.ttf*) and place it into the same directory that contains the program. I can't include it here because of possible copyright issues.  It can be downloaded from https://legionfonts.com/fonts/lucon .
